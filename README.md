# Logseq Digital Garden

This is my Logseq Digital Garden from all the time I spent working on Lisa's computer. I have my computer now and it is time to finally import this awesome collection of notes, thoughts, and whatever else came out of my brain and into LogSeq. 

You should check it out - it's pretty awesome.
